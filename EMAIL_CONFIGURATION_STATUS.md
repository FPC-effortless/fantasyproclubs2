# 📧 Email Configuration Status & Options

## 🚨 Current Situation

You mentioned that **Resend and Supabase settings are correct**, but the email test is still failing with:
```
❌ Signup failed: Error sending confirmation email
```

This suggests there might be a configuration mismatch somewhere.

## 🧪 Quick Email Test

Let's determine if your email service is actually working:

### **Test 1: Check Environment**
```bash
# Check if .env.local exists and has Resend key
echo $RESEND_API_KEY
# Should show your API key starting with "re_"
```

### **Test 2: Verify Supabase Settings**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication > Settings > SMTP Settings
3. Verify:
   - SMTP Host: `smtp.resend.com`
   - SMTP Port: `587`
   - SMTP User: `resend`
   - SMTP Password: `[Your Resend API Key]`
   - **"Enable email confirmations" toggle is ON**

### **Test 3: Simple Registration Test**
Try registering with a real email address:
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/login
2. Register with your actual email
3. Check if you receive the verification email
